### Hi, I'm Mitch

- 💻 I've been programming casually for about a year, and diving deeper into it now
- 🐹 I primarily use Go nowadays, with some experience in Python
- 🛠️ I'm interested in learning low-level concepts and systems programming later down the road
- ⚙️ Currently focused on backend development with Go
- 🌐 Planning to pick up frontend skills as well to round things out
